*  Lesional volume is a powerful and commonly used biomarker in Brain MRI
analysis and interpretation.
* Volume estimation is usually carried out through image segmentation, relying on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on an annotated
database, comprising both images and their corresponding manual delineations.
* To help clinicians focus on the more subtle regions, we propose to associate quantitative Predictive Intervals (PIs)  for Volume estimations.
* It is made out of a Research paper which was published around 23rd September.
* What we tried to do is to take a step towards improvement and use up a New Pooling Technique called Stochastic Pooling(from yet another paper published around 2013).
* All the Research Papers that are used are added in this Repo for Reference.
