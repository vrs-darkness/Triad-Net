*  Lesional volume is a powerful and commonly used biomarker in Brain MRI
analysis and interpretation.
* Volume estimation is usually carried out through image segmentation, relying on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on an annotated
database, comprising both images and their corresponding manual delineations.
* To help clinicians to focus on the more subtle regions, we propose to associate quantitative Predictive Intervals (PIs)  for Volume estimations.
